# PS5 Launcher

A PS5-style home screen for Linux and macOS. Browse PS5 games with their official artwork, download and
install them, and play them with the [KytyPS5](https://github.com/KytyPS5/KytyPS5) emulator,
using a controller, keyboard or mouse.

![PS5 Launcher: moving through the Home screen, a Game Hub and the Library](docs/demo/demo-loop.webp)

- **Your games on a PS5-style Home screen**, with official backgrounds, logos and trailers that
  play right in the launcher.
- **A Library of 400+ PS5 games** with search, genre filters and sorting.
- **See what runs:** every game shows how far it gets in KytyPS5.
- **Download, install and play** without leaving the launcher.
- **Keeps itself and KytyPS5 up to date**, without touching your saves.

## Install

You need 64-bit Linux: Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+, Mint 21+, Arch or SteamOS 3.
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/MohamedAliRashad/ps5-launcher/releases/latest/download/ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz && ./ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64/install.sh
```

**PS5 Launcher** is now in your app menu. For trailers, switching between a game and the
launcher, and installing from archives, also run (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint):

```bash
sudo apt install xdotool mpv libarchive13
```

To uninstall: `./ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64/install.sh --uninstall`

## macOS

macOS 11 or later, Apple Silicon or Intel. KytyPS5's macOS build is x86-64 (with its own copy of MoltenVK for Vulkan), so on Apple Silicon it runs through
Rosetta 2.

1. Install the prerequisites once (Rosetta is for Apple Silicon only):

   ```bash
   softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
   brew install libarchive mpv   # mpv provides libmpv, which plays trailers inside the launcher
   ```

2. Download `ps5-launcher-macos-universal.zip` from the Releases page and unzip it.
3. Move **PS5 Launcher** to Applications.
4. Open it once as described under **"Not Opened" warning** below.
5. Continue with **Getting started** below. The launcher downloads KytyPS5 for you.

### "Not Opened: Apple could not verify…" warning

The app isn't notarized (that needs a paid Apple Developer account), so macOS blocks the first
launch of anything downloaded through a browser. It doesn't mean the file is damaged. Do one of:

- Right-click **PS5 Launcher** and choose **Open**, then **Open** again in the dialog.
- Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to the
  blocked "PS5 Launcher" message (it appears after the first blocked attempt).
- Or in a terminal, remove the download flag:

  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/PS5 Launcher.app"
  ```

If you downloaded just the bare `ps5-launcher` binary (for example a CI build) instead of the app,
it also needs the executable bit: `chmod +x ps5-launcher && xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ps5-launcher`.
Prefer the app: the bare binary has no icon and some window features work worse.

Controllers (through the system's game controller support), sound effects, games started outside
the launcher, choosing a display in Settings, and automatic updates of the app all work on macOS too.

What's different on macOS:

- **Many games won't start yet, and on Apple Silicon possibly none.** KytyPS5 needs Vulkan features
  that MoltenVK (the Vulkan-on-Metal layer) doesn't provide on Apple GPUs, and it exits at startup
  with "Could not find suitable device … image view minLod / shaderBufferInt64Atomics /
  shaderCullDistance is not supported". The launcher shows that reason when it happens. This is a
  limit of the emulator and MoltenVK, not of the launcher; see the compatibility badges on the
  game cards and kytyps5.github.io.
- **Switching between a game and the launcher** (the Tab and PS button shortcuts, Resume) needs
  *Privacy & Security → Accessibility* permission for PS5 Launcher. Without it the launcher still
  starts and stops games, but can't raise or close their windows.
  The app is signed ad hoc, so macOS may ask for the permission again after an update.
- **Automatic updates** replace the whole app, so it must be somewhere you can write to (such as
  `/Applications` as an admin user). Otherwise download the new zip.

## Getting started

1. Open **PS5 Launcher** from your app menu, or run this in a terminal:

   ```bash
   ps5-launcher
   ```

   The first launch downloads artwork and KytyPS5, which takes about a minute.
2. Already have games? Add their folder in **Settings → Game folders**.
3. To get a game, open it in the **Library**, choose **Download**, then **Install**, then
   **Play**. Keep the launcher open while it downloads.

> Only download games you own. Downloads use BitTorrent: other people can see your IP address,
> and finished downloads are shared while the launcher is open (turn this off in
> **Settings → Seed completed downloads**).

## Controls

| Action | Controller | Keyboard |
|---|---|---|
| Move / Select / Back | D-pad, ✕, ○ | Arrows, Enter, Esc |
| Options for a game | Options | O |
| Search | △ | / |
| Switch Home ⇄ Library | L1 / R1 | Tab |
| Switch between game and launcher | PS button | |
| Downloads | | Ctrl+D |

**Games play best with a controller.** DualSense, DualShock 4, Xbox and most other controllers
work in games over USB or Bluetooth with no setup; connect yours before starting a game. Without
one, games use the keyboard: **J I K L** for ✕ △ □ ○, **W A S D** to move, **arrow keys** for the
D-pad and **Enter** for Options. See **Settings → Keyboard controls in games** for every key.

## Will my game run?

Each game shows a tag from the [KytyPS5 compatibility list](https://kytyps5.github.io/):
🟢 **In-game**, 🟡 **Menus**, 🟠 **Boots** (intro logos only), 🔴 **Doesn't boot**, or ⚪ **Untested**.

Linux results come first. A result from Windows is marked **Win**, because games can behave
differently on Linux. In the Library, **In-game** lists every game that reaches gameplay, and
**In-game on Linux** only the ones confirmed on Linux.

**Help others:** when you close a game, the launcher asks how far it got, and your answer
becomes its tag on your PC. Every so often, choose **Settings → Share your results with
KytyPS5** to send your results to the community list (needs a free GitHub account).

## Help

- **A game closes right away:** check its tag, then **Options → View emulator log**.
- **Resume or Stop doesn't work:** install `xdotool`.
- **Wrong screen:** change **Settings → Display**. For a window, run `ps5-launcher --windowed`.
- **Too big or too small:** run `PS5_LAUNCHER_SCALE=1.15 ps5-launcher` (bigger number, bigger UI).
- **A new KytyPS5 broke a game:** **Settings → Roll back to previous KytyPS5**.
